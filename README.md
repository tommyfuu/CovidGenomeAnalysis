# CovidGenomeAnalysis

Covid genome analysis project at the HMC BioMakerspace. Using machine learning to investigate the pattern between location and covid sequences.

### The GISAIDExtract Directory

The working python file is ORFExtractor.py, where we can take in an input fasta file (example file see 'GISAIDExtract/EPI_ISL_402124.fasta') and output the rough orf and alignment score with the reference file.
